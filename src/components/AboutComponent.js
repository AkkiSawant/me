              I am experienced senior backend developer having quick learning, ability to collaborate with teams and work as an individual too. Excellect team player with great communication skills.
              
              I love writing optimized code and providing solutions for any kind of problems (only problems that can be solved technically). 
                I constantly look for upgrading my technical skills and learning new technology that can help me provide better solutions for my backend services , my frontend views or deploying by application. 
                I have always been a team player and love to fill in gaps which helps to build a strong team which can help achieve any difficult task at hand. 
                Adapting to changes has always been one of my core strength which is evident from the fact that I have worked across organization that provide solutions on different domains.
